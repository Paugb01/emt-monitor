# emt-monitor
Tired of the irregularity in the EMT Valencia buses frequencies? 
I configured this alarm using a previous existing repository which connects to the EMT API. 
It retrieves the time left for the line and stop you select. When time to your bus is less than you set, you will get a notification.

That way you can stop worrying about the time you have to leave home and do other things instead!

Hope it proves useful for you!
